## Simple AWS Test of API and Parameters ##

The test here is several-fold:

    Firstly, testing CodeBuild, CodeDeploy and CodePipeline from a github repo.
    Secondly, using Parameter Store to configure the simple application.

I guess this'll be deployed eventually to an EC2 instance.  It only needs to be simple.
